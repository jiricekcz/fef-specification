# Negation 

# Abstract

The negation expression is a unary operator expression that represents the negation of an expression. It is used to represent the negative value of an expression. Unless there is a very good reason to do otherwise, if a value supports addition and negation, the addition of a value and its negation should be equal to a zero-like value.

# Expression Data
