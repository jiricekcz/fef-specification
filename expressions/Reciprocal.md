# Reciprocal Expression

## Abstract

The reciprocal expression is a unary operator expression that represents the reciprocal of an expression. It is used to represent the multiplicative inverse of an expression. Unless there is a very good reason to do otherwise, if a value supports multiplication and reciprocal, the multiplication of a value and its reciprocal should be equal to a one-like value.
