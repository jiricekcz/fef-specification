# Integer datatypes

Integer datatypes follow the standard implementation of signed and unsigned integers. The integer datatypes are defined by the number of bits of information they convey and whether they are signed or unsigned. 

## Supported types

The following floating point formats can be passed to expressions and returned by expressions:

| Short name (identifier) | Name                     | Information |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| `i8`                    | 8-bit signed integer     | 8 bits      |
| `i16`                   | 16-bit signed integer    | 16 bits     |
| `i32`                   | 32-bit signed integer    | 32 bits     |
| `i64`                   | 64-bit signed integer    | 64 bits     |
| `i128`                  | 128-bit signed integer   | 128 bits    |
| `u8`                    | 8-bit unsigned integer   | 8 bits      |
| `u16`                   | 16-bit unsigned integer  | 16 bits     |
| `u32`                   | 32-bit unsigned integer  | 32 bits     |
| `u64`                   | 64-bit unsigned integer  | 64 bits     |
| `u128`                  | 128-bit unsigned integer | 128 bits    |
