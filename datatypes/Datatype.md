# Datatype 

Datatype is the runtime shape of a value. It describes data returned by expressions and the data that is passed to expressions. The basic datatypes are similar to the basic types in programming languages.

No specific binary format for these values is defined. It is up to the implementation to decide how to represent these values in memory. The specification will however define certain behaviors and properties of these datatypes - most of which will be defined in the expression definitions.
